            <p>Welcome to my very first personal website. 
                I'm a student in Univeristy of the Cordilleras
                majoring in Web Technologies who is still
                familiarizing CSS and no knowledge in JavaScript.
                I created this personal portfolio to share my 
                experiences, and insights. Whether you're a fellow
                enthusiast in Website Developing or just curious about the
                person behind the screen, I hope you find inspiration and connection
                within these digital pages. <br>

                <br>The allure of web development for me lies in its fusion
                of creativity and logic. It's like building a digital
                playground where imagination meets functionality. Armed
                with a toolkit of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I'm crafting
                the pixels that bring ideas to life. Every line of code is
                a stroke on the canvas of the internet, and I'm thrilled
                to share my evolving portfolio showcasing projects that
                reflect my dedication to mastering the art and science of
                web development. <br>

                <br>Beyond the professional realm, I am a firm believer
                in the importance of work-life balance.
                When I'm not designing,
                you'll likely find me lifting in the gym.
                This website isn't just about my professional journeyâ€”
                it's a holistic representation of who I am.
                I invite you to explore, connect, and join me
                on this multifaceted adventure. Thanks for stopping by,
                and I look forward to the conversations and connections
                that will undoubtedly unfold in this digital space!
